CAV Test and Evaluation
====
This part have two sections or stages. Basicly, we established an augment reality based CAV testbed based on [Dr.Yu's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chunhui_Yu) previous work. Then, we build a scaled vehicle testbed for indoor evaluation.

1）Vehicle-in-the-loop Simulation Testbed
----
The main task of this section is to use VISSIM's secondary development technology to send the internal simulation environment of VISSIM (including pedestrians, non-motor vehicles, vehicles and transportation facilities) to the real environment, using standard message frames in the V2X message set ( RSI, BSM, MAP, SPat, RSM) are sent to vehicles and facilities in real-world scenarios. Scenes and facilities become a part of the simulation, and the test environments rely on augmented reality technology. This environment can effectively improve the speed and quality of CAV testing.

2）Scaled-Vehicle-in-the-Loop Simulation Testbed
----
This section describes scaled-vehicle-in-the-loop testbed. Real vehicles are often costly in the real test environment. Setting up a 10/1 scaled test environment in the lab can effectively reduce the cost of testing and avoid various types of unpredictable conditions (such as irregular friction, weather, etc.) in the real test site. The indoor test platform built a miniature test platform in the Tongji University laboratory.
